Hi, I'm sneakerhax,

I have spent the last eight years on [Red Teams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team), helping some of the world's largest software companies discover soft spots in their security posture. Additionally, I demonstrate the impact of exploiting those weaknesses, test the response capabilities of Blue Teams and Incident Responders, and identify systemic security process issues at scale. Before working on Red Teams, I spent eight years in Information Technology as a Systems Administrator.

## Github Overview

My Github contains documentation, posts, tools, and experimental code for Offensive Security purposes. I use many elements in these code repos, either in their current state or a modified/updated version, to perform my job daily.

## Areas of interest:

* Red Team
* Offensive Security
* Cloud
* Containers
* Kubernetes
